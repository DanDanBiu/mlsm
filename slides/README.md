These presentations are written in Markdown and converted to use impress.js via [mdpress](https://github.com/egonSchiele/mdpress).

E.g.: 
`mdpress --latex -a overview.md`

The results are stored in GitHub pages, e.g., 
<http://aronwc.github.io/mlsm/01-overview>

The code for those webpages is available on the `gh-pages` branch of this repo.
