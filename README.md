These presentations are written in Markup and converted to use impress.js via [mdpress](https://github.com/egonSchiele/mdpress).

E.g.: 
`mdpress --latex -a overview.md`

It is intended that you clone this repo and view the slides locally. However, you can view tham directly on GitHub using [RawGitHub](https://rawgithub.com/). For example, here is the first lecture:


<https://rawgithub.com/aronwc/mlsm/master/slides/01-overview/overview/index.html>

To repeat for other lectures, navigate to the index.html file, click raw, then "drop the dot" in the URL; e.g., from `raw.github.com` to `rawgithub.com`.
